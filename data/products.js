      "A century ago, vertical stripes were a familiar addition to Manchester United away shirts. For the 23/24 season, adidas dipped into the club's DNA to produce an authentic football jersey with a design that looks the part. The Manchester United 23/24 Away Authentic Jersey was created to perform. The lightweight shirt features HEAT.RDY that maximizes airflow so you can feel cool. Standing out over those stripes, a heat-applied club badge signals your support for the legendary team. This garment is made with a yarn which contains 50% Parley Ocean Plastic — reimagined plastic waste, intercepted on remote islands, beaches, coastal communities and shorelines — preventing it from polluting our ocean.",
